GeospatIal Distribution DYnamics (giddy) in PySAL
=================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pysal/giddy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pysal/giddy)

Space–time analytics that consider the role of space in the evolution
 of distributions over time.

Features
--------

- Spatially explicit Markov methods:
    - Spatial Markov and inference
    - LISA Markov and inference
- Spatilly explicit rank-based methods:
    - Spatial decomposition of exchange mobility measure
- Income mobility measures
